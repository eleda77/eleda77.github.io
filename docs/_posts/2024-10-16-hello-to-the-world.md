So I figured I'd make a website. However, I didn't fully think this through before diving in. So it's definitely going to be a work in progress for a while until I figure out exactly what I want to do with this. Which may be never. But at least I have a website now!

I think overall I just wanted somewhere to publish my lovely list of vocab, and also a place where I can ramble about my naive philosophical wonderings and opinions on life. So I guess we'll just have to see what becomes of this.
